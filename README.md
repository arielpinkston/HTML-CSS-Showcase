This website showcases my skills in HTML and CSS through a clean, responsive design with dedicated Home, Projects, and Style Guide pages. The Projects page features exercises that demonstrate my ability to structure and style content, while the Style Guide includes reusable components and custom design elements. Together, they highlight my understanding of web layout, typography, and consistent styling practices.
