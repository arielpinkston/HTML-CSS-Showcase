    <h2>Organized by Wichita Open Streets ICT</h2>
    <p>"Open Streets ICT is a FREE community building event that 
    closes a usually busy street to traffic and opens it for 
    biking, walking, running, dancing, yoga, and more! All 
    Wichitans are invited to join in the fun, and to stop at the 
    local businesses, restaurants, street vendors, and the major 
    activity hubs situated every mile along the route.</p>

    <p>Open Streets ICT provides more than just opportunities for 
    physical exercise â€” it's an exercise in building community, 
    cultural identity, and social engagement. By temporarily 
    removing the danger of motor vehicles, Open Streets provide 
    a novel type of public space that helps people make social 
    connections and lets them view their city through a new lens.</p>
    
    <p>A long the route there will be many restaurants, businesses 
    and organizations participating with food, activities and fun 
    for all ages and physical levels to enjoy."</p>
