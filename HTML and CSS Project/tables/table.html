        <h1>My Art Journey</h1>
        <p>
            One of my greatest passions is creating art. I love the feeling of 
            control it gives me. I get to decide how the finished product is going 
            to look. In addition to that, I love that this is a hobby I can progress 
            in throughout my life. I started my art journey a few years ago, and I 
            have experienced monumental improvement since then. To say the least, 
            I'm excited to see how my talents in art will develop in the years to 
            come.

        <h2>The Beginning</h2>
        <p>
            When I first started drawing and creating art, I began by sketching 
            with simple pencil and paper. Soon after this, I discovered As time 
            went on and I got better with that, I worked up the courage the social 
            media platforms of other artists. Seeing the work of these artists 
            inspired me to keep going when I wanted to give up. Their tips helped 
            me to improve my own methods. Most of the artists I admired worked in 
            digital art, and this was one of the main factors that encouraged me to 
            dabble in digital art. In my senior year of high school, I took a 
            painting class that completely changed my outlook on art. Without that 
            class, I would have never discovered my passion for the art medium of 
            acrylic paint and canvas. In retrospect, I can say with confidence that 
            my experience in digital art was the foundation for my talent for 
            painting with acrylics.
        </p>
        <h2>Today</h2>
        <p>
            Recently, I have been trying to go back to what I started with: 
            sketching with pencil and paper. I decided to go back to this method 
            because I want to primarily focus on building a good foundation. I 
            try my best to sketch for a few minutes every day, and while I can't
            always make this happen, the repetition of this method has helped 
            me improve greatly. Before I started doing this, I would agonize 
            over every line and curve. Now, I have enough confidence to let my 
            mind go and just draw. I can simply focus on my reference picture 
            and let my hand copy it. This was another thing that following art 
            influencers helped me with. One of the most popular topics that art
            influencers stress is practicing regularly because that will help 
            one gain confidence in drawing. Not only that, I have also learned
            that you must always use a reference picture, especially if you're
            a beginner at drawing. While some believe using a reference picture 
            is “cheating,” I firmly believe that using reference pictures is how 
            an artist learns how to draw in the first place. Above all else, I 
            believe this is what has helped me the most. By using and copying 
            reference pictures, I have learned what objects actually look like.
        </p>
        <h2>My Passion</h2> 
        <p>
            My favorite thing to draw is people. There are an infinite number of 
            positions and expressions a person can appear in. While this fact 
            could be overwhelming to some artists, this is what attracts me to 
            my passion for drawing people. More specifically, I love being able 
            to capture emotion. I love identifying the facets of each line and 
            how those make up the person I am drawing. I love taking 
            inspiration from the uniqueness of the people in my reference 
            pictures and summarizing them in my drawings.
        </p>
        <h2>Suggested Supplies</h2>
        <p>
            If you would like to start your art journey, I have included a list 
            of products that are great for beginners. Though I suggest starting 
            your journey with simple sketching, it is your journey. You can 
            start it wherever you want! In accordance with that idea, I have 
            listed products for four starting categories: sketching, acrylic 
            painting, watercolor, and ink. I have tried to link products that 
            won't “break the bank.” In addition, many of these products are what 
            I use!
