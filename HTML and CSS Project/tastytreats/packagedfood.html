    <p>There are so many packaged foods in circulation that choosing just one is difficult. However, I think one of my favorites has to be chocolate. It's a wonderful ingredient in other recipes, it's delicious on its own, and it comes in a convenient package. While there are three kinds of chocolate</p> 
        <ul>
            <li>White</li>
            <li>Dark</li>
            <li>Milk</li>
        </ul> 
        <p>my favorite kind is dark. The extra cocoa powder truly brings out the best flavors of the chocolate.</p>
